# Python-BMP280
Raspberri Pi Python Library for the Bosch BMP280

This library when completed is intended to work like the Adafruit Python Library for the BMP085/BMP180 for the Raspberry Pi. 

Currently it will talk to the board but I don't have the packaging setup and the temperatures and pressure reading isn't working.
